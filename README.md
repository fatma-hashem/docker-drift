# # 🐳 Docker Drift

Detect and report **drift** between running Docker containers and their original images.  
Drift occurs when files, packages, or configurations inside a container are changed without updating the Dockerfile.

---

## ✨ Features
- 🔍 File system change detection (`docker diff`)
- 📦 Package difference checking (coming soon)
- 📑 Multiple output formats (Markdown / JSON)
- ⚡ CI/CD-friendly exit codes for automation

---

## 🚀 Why Docker Drift?
In DevOps and production environments, containers often **drift** when:
- Packages are manually installed inside running containers  
- Configurations are updated without changing the image  
- Security patches are applied directly in containers  

This leads to:
- ❌ Inconsistent environments  
- ❌ Security vulnerabilities  
- ❌ Hard-to-reproduce bugs  

**Docker Drift helps catch those issues early.**
